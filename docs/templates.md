# Templates

Twig is the simple, yet powerful templating engine provided by Symfony. 

All Twig templates with the extension `*.twig` are stored in the directory: `templates/`

Twig templates will be converted to native PHP code and cached until the template changes. 
This means that Twig does not add much overhead to your application.
