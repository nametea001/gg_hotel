# Validation

Depending on the use case, different strategies are appropriate for the input validation.

## Form validation

If you need to validate complex form data (arrays) against a specific set of rules, try 
[cakephp/validation](https://github.com/cakephp/validation).

If you want to collect validation errors and throw validation exceptions, 
try [selective/validation](https://github.com/selective-php/validation)
